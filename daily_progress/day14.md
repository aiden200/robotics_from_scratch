### **Day 14**

- **PAPER: Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor Pt 2**
  - Learning from multiple policies (two Q values)
  - Matching the optimal soft Q-distribution
  - Target network, reward scaling
- **Paper Implementation: PPO pt 6 / Omniverse Development pt 2**
  - Started minibatching and supporting multi actors.
  - This is going to be a bigger pain than what I thought it would be, might take a while.
  - PPO Code located in [here](../code/models/ppo.py)
  - cartpole environment located in [here](../code/environment/cartPole.py)
